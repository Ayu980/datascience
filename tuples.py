# Tuple: a list of values grouped together
# In LIST: all values have similar meaning (homogeneous)
# In TUPLE: all values have different meaning (heterogeneous)
point =(5, 9)
# here 5 is the x coordinate ad 9 represent the y coordinate
# Examples of TUPLES are:
    # point=(4,5) # 4 is x coordinate, 5 is y coordinate
    # address=("1 purple street", "new york", 10001
# Tuples are IMMUTABLE
